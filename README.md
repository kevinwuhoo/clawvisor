AI agents are getting good at doing things. The problem is letting them — safely. Give an agent your Gmail credentials and it can read, send, and delete anything. Refuse, and it can't help you at all.

Clawvisor sits in the middle. Agents never hold credentials. Instead, they declare **tasks** describing what they need to do, the user approves the scope, and Clawvisor handles credential injection, execution, and audit logging for every request under that task.

The typical flow: a user asks their agent to triage their inbox. The agent creates a Clawvisor task declaring what it needs — read emails, but ask before sending. The user approves the scope once, and the agent makes as many requests as it needs within that scope without further interruption. Actions outside the scope go to the user for per-request approval. Restrictions can hard-block specific actions entirely.

Approve a purpose, not a permission. Clawvisor enforces it on every request.

## Get Started

### Sign up (recommended)

The fastest way to try Clawvisor is hosted: sign up at [clawvisor.com](https://clawvisor.com). No installation required — connect services and agents directly from the dashboard.

### Self-host

Prefer to run Clawvisor yourself? Install the daemon:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawvisor.com/install.sh | sh
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Run your agent in a separate environment from Clawvisor** — a sandboxed container, separate machine, or cloud VM. If the agent shares a host with Clawvisor, it can bypass the gateway by reading the database or process environment directly.

This downloads the latest binary, adds it to your PATH, and starts an interactive setup wizard that walks you through configuration — database, LLM provider for intent verification, Google OAuth, and more. No Go, Node, or Docker required.

Once setup completes, the daemon opens the web dashboard in your browser automatically.

### Connect your agent

With Clawvisor running (hosted or self-hosted), connect your agent:

```bash
clawvisor-server connect-agent
```

This auto-detects installed agents (Claude Code, Claude Desktop) and walks you through connecting them. You can also target a specific agent directly:

```bash
clawvisor-server connect-agent claude-code      # install skill + env vars for Claude Code
clawvisor-server connect-agent claude-desktop   # configure MCP for Claude Desktop
```

For manual setup or other agents, see the integration guides: [Claude Code](docs/INTEGRATE_CLAUDE_CODE.md) · [Claude Desktop (MCP)](docs/INTEGRATE_CLAUDE_COWORK.md) · [OpenClaw](docs/INTEGRATE_OPENCLAW.md) · [Any HTTP agent](docs/INTEGRATE_GENERIC.md)

### Other self-host options

<details>
<summary>From source (Go + Node)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawvisor/clawvisor.git
cd clawvisor
make setup    # interactive config wizard
make run      # start server (SQLite, magic link auth)
make tui      # terminal dashboard (separate terminal)
```

`make setup` generates `config.yaml` and a `vault.key` (database, Google OAuth, intent verification). `make run` starts the server, creates an `admin@local` user, and opens the dashboard via a magic link. `make tui` auto-authenticates using the local session file.

Requires Go 1.25+ and Node.js 18+. See [docs/SETUP_LOCAL.md](docs/SETUP_LOCAL.md) for details.

```

Every gateway request passes through three authorization layers, checked in order:

1. **Restrictions** — hard blocks you configure on specific service/action pairs. If a restriction matches, the request is denied immediately. Use these for actions you never want any agent to take (e.g. "no agent can delete calendar events").
2. **Task scopes** — the primary mechanism. When an agent needs to do something, it creates a task declaring the purpose and which service/action pairs it needs. You review and approve the scope once. After that, requests under that task execute without further interruption — you approved the purpose, not each individual call. Tasks can be session-scoped (expire after a TTL) or standing (persist until you revoke them).
3. **Per-request approval** — the fallback. Any request that isn't covered by a task scope goes to the approval queue, and you're notified via the dashboard, Telegram, or push notification to your phone. This is the default for actions the agent didn't declare upfront, or for task actions marked `auto_execute: false` (e.g. sending emails).

When a task is created, Clawvisor can optionally run an **LLM-powered risk assessment** that evaluates the scope breadth, purpose-scope coherence, and internal consistency of the task. The assessment produces a risk level (low, medium, high, critical) shown in the dashboard to help inform your approval decision. High and critical risk tasks require a confirmation step before approval.

For multi-step tasks, **chain context verification** tracks structural facts (IDs, email addresses, phone numbers) extracted from adapter results and feeds them into subsequent verification prompts. This prevents a compromised agent from reading an inbox and then targeting an entity not present in the results. Chain context is activated by passing a consistent `session_id` across related gateway requests.

All three LLM subsystems (intent verification, chain context extraction, and task risk assessment) are covered by eval suites totaling 249 cases. See [docs/eval-results.md](docs/eval-results.md) for accuracy breakdowns and failure analysis.

## Supported Services

| Service ID | Service | Actions |
|---|---|---|
| `google.gmail` | Gmail | `list_messages`, `get_message`, `send_message` |
| `google.calendar` | Google Calendar | `list_events`, `get_event`, `create_event`, `update_event`, `delete_event`, `list_calendars` |
| `google.drive` | Google Drive | `list_files`, `get_file`, `create_file`, `update_file`, `search_files` |
| `google.contacts` | Google Contacts | `list_contacts`, `get_contact`, `search_contacts` |
| `microsoft.outlook` | Outlook | `list_messages`, `get_message`, `send_message`, `list_events`, `get_event`, `create_event` |

| `github` | GitHub | `list_issues`, `get_issue`, `create_issue`, `comment_issue`, `list_prs`, `get_pr`, `list_repos`, `search_code` |
| `slack` | Slack | `list_channels`, `get_channel`, `list_messages`, `send_message`, `search_messages`, `list_users` |
| `notion` | Notion | `search`, `get_page`, `create_page`, `update_page`, `query_database`, `list_databases` |
| `linear` | Linear | `list_issues`, `get_issue`, `create_issue`, `update_issue`, `add_comment`, `list_teams`, `list_projects`, `search_issues` |
| `stripe` | Stripe | `list_customers`, `get_customer`, `list_charges`, `get_charge`, `list_subscriptions`, `get_subscription`, `create_refund`, `get_balance` |
| `twilio` | Twilio | `send_sms`, `send_whatsapp`, `list_messages`, `get_message` |
| `apple.imessage` | iMessage | `search_messages`, `list_threads`, `get_thread`, `send_message` |

Google services share a single OAuth connection — activating one activates all four. GitHub, Slack, Notion, Linear, Stripe, and Twilio each use per-user API keys/tokens. iMessage reads the local `chat.db` on macOS and is always available without activation on supported machines.

## Agent Integration

### Create an agent token

In the dashboard, create an agent and copy the bearer token. The agent uses this for all API calls.

### Tasks

Tasks are the primary authorization mechanism. An agent declares what it needs to do — the purpose, the specific service/action pairs, and whether each can auto-execute — and the user approves the scope once. After that, every gateway request under that task runs without per-request approval (for `auto_execute` actions).

Without a task, every request goes to the approval queue individually.

#### Creating a task

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$CLAWVISOR_URL/api/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "purpose": "Triage inbox and draft replies",
    "authorized_actions": [
      {"service": "google.gmail", "action": "list_messages", "auto_execute": true, "expected_use": "List recent emails to identify unread messages"},
      {"service": "google.gmail", "action": "get_message", "auto_execute": true, "expected_use": "Read individual emails to assess priority"},
      {"service": "google.gmail", "action": "send_message", "auto_execute": false}
    ],
    "expires_in_seconds": 1800,
    "callback_url": "https://your-agent/callback"
  }'
```

The task starts as `pending_approval`. The user approves it via the dashboard, Telegram, or a push notification on their phone. Include a `callback_url` to receive a callback when the task is approved or denied — otherwise poll `GET /api/tasks/{id}` (supports long-polling).

Key fields:

- **`purpose`** — shown to the user during approval and used by intent verification to check that requests are consistent with the declared intent
- **`auto_execute`** — `true` means in-scope requests execute immediately; `false` means they still go to per-request approval (useful for destructive actions like `send_message`)
- **`expected_use`** — per-action description of how the agent intends to use it, shown during approval and checked by intent verification
- **`expires_in_seconds`** — session tasks expire after this TTL once approved

#### Session vs standing tasks

**Session tasks** (the default) expire after their TTL. Use these for bounded work like "triage my inbox" or "review this PR."

**Standing tasks** have no expiry and remain active until the user revokes them. Use these for ongoing workflows:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$CLAWVISOR_URL/api/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "purpose": "Ongoing email triage",
    "lifetime": "standing",
    "authorized_actions": [
      {"service": "google.gmail", "action": "list_messages", "auto_execute": true},
      {"service": "google.gmail", "action": "get_message", "auto_execute": true}
    ]
  }'
```

#### Task lifecycle

1. **`pending_approval`** — created, waiting for user approval
2. **`active`** — approved, gateway requests with this `task_id` are authorized
3. **`pending_scope_expansion`** — agent requested a new action via `POST /api/tasks/{id}/expand`
4. **`completed`** — agent marked the task done via `POST /api/tasks/{id}/complete`
5. **`expired`** — session task TTL elapsed
6. **`revoked`** — user revoked the task from the dashboard
7. **`denied`** — user denied the task or scope expansion

#### Scope expansion

If the agent needs an action not in the original scope, it requests expansion:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$CLAWVISOR_URL/api/tasks/<task-id>/expand" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "service": "google.gmail",
    "action": "send_message",
    "auto_execute": false,
    "reason": "User asked me to reply to the triage summary"
  }'
```

The user is notified and can approve or deny. On approval, the action is added and the session task TTL is reset. Standing tasks cannot be expanded — create a separate task instead.

### Gateway requests

Once a task is active, the agent makes gateway requests under it:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$CLAWVISOR_URL/api/gateway/request" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "service": "google.gmail",
    "action": "list_messages",
    "params": {"max_results": 10, "query": "is:unread"},
    "reason": "Checking for unread messages to triage",
    "request_id": "req-001",
    "task_id": "task-uuid-here",
    "context": {
      "source": "user_message",
      "callback_url": "https://your-agent/callback"
    }
  }'
```

Requests without a `task_id` go to per-request approval automatically.

### Response statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `executed` | Action completed. Result in `result.summary` and `result.data`. |
| `pending` | Awaiting human approval. Use `?wait=true` on the original POST to block until resolved, or call `POST /api/gateway/request/{request_id}/execute` after approval. |
| `blocked` | A restriction blocks this action. Do not retry. |
| `restricted` | Intent verification rejected the request. Adjust params/reason and retry with a new `request_id`. |
| `pending_task_approval` | Task declared but not yet approved by the user. |
| `pending_scope_expansion` | Action is outside the task scope. Call `POST /api/tasks/{id}/expand`. |
| `task_expired` | Task TTL elapsed. Expand to extend, or create a new task. |
| `error` | Execution failed. Check `error` field. `code: SERVICE_NOT_CONFIGURED` means the service needs activation. |

### Callbacks

Callbacks carry a `type` field (`"request"` or `"task"`) and use dedicated ID fields.

When a pending gateway request resolves, Clawvisor POSTs to the request's `callback_url`:

```json
{
  "type": "request",
  "request_id": "req-001",
  "status": "executed",
  "result": {"summary": "Found 3 unread messages", "data": [...]},
  "audit_id": "a8f3..."
}
```

When a task is approved, denied, expanded, or expires, Clawvisor POSTs to the task's `callback_url`:

```json
{
  "type": "task",
  "task_id": "task-uuid",
  "status": "approved"
}
```

Task callback statuses: `approved`, `denied`, `scope_expanded`, `scope_expansion_denied`, `expired`.

For the full agent protocol, see [`skills/clawvisor/SKILL.md`](skills/clawvisor/SKILL.md).

## Dashboard

The web UI provides:

- **Overview** — pending approvals queue, activity charts, and notification setup
- **Tasks** — view active/standing tasks, approve/deny/revoke task scopes, filterable by status
- **Services** — activate services via OAuth (Google) or API key (GitHub, Slack, Notion, etc.), re-authenticate, manage aliases
- **Restrictions** — toggle hard blocks on service/action pairs
- **Agents** — create agent tokens, manage connection requests
- **Gateway log** — searchable audit trail of every gateway request with outcomes and verification results
- **Settings** — device pairing (QR code for mobile), Telegram notification setup, password management, account settings
- **Onboarding** — guided first-run flow for connecting services, creating agents, and setting up notifications
- **Light/dark mode** — toggle in the sidebar; persists across sessions

## TUI

The terminal dashboard (`clawvisor-server tui`) provides the same approval and monitoring capabilities without leaving the terminal.

```bash
# After setup + server are running:
make tui

# Or directly:
clawvisor-server tui

# With explicit connection details:
clawvisor-server tui --url http://localhost:25297 --token <refresh_token>
```

Authentication is automatic in local mode. The flow:

1. `clawvisor-server server` writes `~/.clawvisor/.local-session` with a one-time magic token
2. `clawvisor-server tui` reads this file, exchanges the token via `POST /api/auth/magic`, and saves the resulting refresh token to `~/.clawvisor/config.yaml`
3. Subsequent launches use the saved refresh token directly

For password-mode servers, the TUI prompts for email and password on first launch.

You can also set credentials via environment variables:

```bash
export CLAWVISOR_URL=http://localhost:25297
export CLAWVISOR_TOKEN=<refresh_token>
clawvisor-server tui
```

## Daemon Mode

The daemon runs Clawvisor as a persistent background service. See [CLI Reference](#cli-reference) for the full list of commands (`start`, `stop`, `status`, `install`, etc.). Configuration and data are stored in `~/.clawvisor/`.

### Remote access via relay

When paired with a mobile device, the daemon connects to `relay.clawvisor.com` via a WebSocket reverse tunnel. This allows the iOS app to reach a local Clawvisor instance behind NAT without port forwarding. The daemon authenticates to the relay using Ed25519 challenge-response. All traffic is routed through `/d/<daemon_id>/api/...` on the relay.

### MCP integration

Clawvisor exposes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server at `/mcp` with OAuth 2.1 for integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients. Tools available via MCP: `fetch_catalog`, `create_task`, `get_task`, `complete_task`, `expand_task`, `gateway_request`. See [docs/INTEGRATE_CLAUDE_COWORK.md](docs/INTEGRATE_CLAUDE_COWORK.md) for setup.

## Proxy-Lite Runtime (preview)

Proxy-lite runs inside the Clawvisor daemon and presents Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoints to command-line agents. It can observe model API calls, intercept tool-use, hold inline approvals, and attribute requests to a registered agent without requiring a CONNECT/TLS MITM proxy.

> [!WARNING]
> **Proxy-lite is in active development.** Behavior, flags, and the API surface may change in any release while it remains pre-1.0. Treat it as preview-quality and pin to a specific Clawvisor version in production.

Register an agent, store its upstream Anthropic or OpenAI key, and run a command through proxy-lite:

```bash
clawvisor-server agent register my-agent
clawvisor-server agent run --agent my-agent -- claude
```

For provider-specific wrappers and raw environment exports, see [docs/LITE_PROXY.md](docs/LITE_PROXY.md).

### Dev commands

```bash
make build                          # full build (Go binary + frontend)
make run                            # local dev server (SQLite, auto-opens browser)
make tui                            # terminal dashboard
make setup                          # re-run interactive setup wizard
make test                           # run all tests
make lint                           # go vet
make eval-intent                    # run LLM intent verification eval suite

make up                             # docker compose (app + postgres)
make web-dev                        # frontend dev server on :5173
make deploy                         # deploy via Cloud Build
make release                        # build release binaries
make clean                          # remove build artifacts
```

## Security Model

- **Agents never receive credentials.** Credentials are injected inside the Clawvisor process after authorization. They are stripped from all responses, logs, and error messages.
- **Vault encryption.** Credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM using a master key (via `VAULT_KEY` env var or `vault.key` file).
- **Audit trail.** Every gateway request is logged with a unique `request_id` (enforced by DB constraint). Outcomes are updated after execution.
- **Response formatting.** Adapter results are semantically formatted — secrets are stripped, HTML/Unicode is sanitized before anything reaches the agent.
- **Device authentication.** Paired mobile devices authenticate via HMAC-SHA256 (signing method, path, timestamp, and body hash). Timestamps are checked within a 5-minute skew tolerance.
- **E2E encryption.** Device-authenticated endpoints support end-to-end encryption using X25519 ECDH key exchange with HKDF key derivation and AES encryption.
- **Relay authentication.** The daemon authenticates to the relay service via Ed25519 challenge-response with a 60-second replay window.
- **Rate limiting.** Per-agent gateway rate limits and per-user limits on OAuth, policy API, and review endpoints.
- **Agent isolation.** Clawvisor's security model assumes the agent can only reach it through the API. When self-hosting, run the agent in a separate environment (sandboxed container, separate machine, or cloud VM) — see the [self-host warning](#self-host).
